                <p>
                    Print Phantom reserves the right to modify, change and/or amend the Site Terms (these Terms and Conditions and/or one, more or all of the additional terms and policies referenced above) from time to time.

                    If the Site Terms are changed, modified and/or amended, Print Phantom will post the new terms on this website and the "last updated" date relevant to the terms and conditions containing the change will be changed. Any changes, modifications and/or amendments will be effective upon the posting of the revised terms to this website.
                </p>

                <p>
                    If you do not agree with any change, modification or amendment Print Phantom may make to the Site Terms, you may withdraw your consent to and agreement to be bound to them by notifying Print Phantom in writing immediately. If you withdraw your consent, however, you must immediately discontinue your use of your account and this website.

The fact that on one or more occasions Print Phantom has elected to notify you via such additional means does not constitute an agreement of any kind by Print Phantom that it will do so in the future; the posting of modifications, changes and/or amendments to this website remains effective notice of such modifications, changes and/or amendments.

                <p>
                    For certain products or services, you may submit data, text, photographs, graphics, or other materials (“Customer Content”) to Print Phantom for inclusion in printed products. You are solely responsible for all Customer Content you provide and warrant that you either own or have permission to use such materials. You agree to indemnify and hold Print Phantom harmless from any claims or costs arising out of content you do not have rights to.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Customer Content is stored for a maximum of fifteen (15) days from the date of order and may then be deleted. It cannot be used to place new orders and is only retained for possible reprints.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You agree not to submit any Customer Content that:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Is unlawful, threatening, abusive, defamatory, or obscene;</li>

                <p>
                    Print Phantom reserves the right to review and remove any Customer Content at its sole discretion and to reject print jobs that violate the Site Terms. Print Phantom may also preserve or disclose Customer Content if legally required or to protect its rights and the safety of others.
                </p>
                <p>
                    All rights to Print Phantom’s original Site Content remain exclusively with Print Phantom, regardless of whether Customer Content is submitted or integrated into any product or service.

            <section id="uploaded-content" class="container pb-4">
                <h4 class="mb-3">Uploaded Content Requirements</h4>
                <p>
                    We strongly recommend that content uploaded to Print Phantom for print fulfillment meets the following specifications:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Resolution:</strong> Minimum of 300 DPI at 1:1 ratio (100%). Content not meeting this standard may appear fuzzy or pixilated, and Print Phantom will not be responsible for such output. While we reserve the right to reject such content, we are not obligated to verify resolution.</li>
                    <li><strong>Color Mode:</strong> Files should be designed and uploaded in CMYK color mode with no embedded color profiles. Uploading in RGB or other formats may result in color shifts upon conversion, for which Print Phantom is not responsible.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section id="color-quality" class="container pb-4">
                <h4 class="mb-3">Color Quality</h4>
                <p>
                    Print Phantom guarantees print quality that meets CMYK industry standards but does not guarantee precise color matching ("match-print" fidelity). Slight color shifts throughout an order are possible and normal.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Due to differences in monitor displays, we cannot guarantee the print colors will exactly match previews on your screen. Additionally, color shifts in black, near-black, or gray tones converted from RGB may occur and must be addressed before submission. Proofs are not guarantees for black or gray output accuracy.
                </p>

            <section id="production-turnaround" class="container pb-4">
                <h4 class="mb-3">Production Turnaround Time</h4>
                <p>
                    Turnaround time varies by product. If not otherwise specified, standard turnaround applies. Turnaround times exclude shipping time. Your delivery estimate combines production and shipping times.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once submitted, production time typically cannot be changed, and billing adjustments will not be made. Print Phantom offers various turnaround options, not all available for every product:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Same Day:</strong> For an additional fee, orders confirmed by 10:00 a.m. will be ready for pick-up/shipping by end of the same day. Orders after 10:00 a.m. will be processed the next business day.</li>
                    <li><strong>Next Business Day:</strong> For a fee, orders confirmed by 10:00 a.m. will be ready the following business day.</li>
                    <li><strong>Next Day Plus 1:</strong> For a fee, orders confirmed by 1:00 p.m. will be ready on the second business day after receipt.</li>
                    <li><strong>2–4 Day:</strong> Orders confirmed by 1:00 p.m. will be ready between the 2nd and 4th business day.</li>
                    <li><strong>5–7 Day:</strong> Orders confirmed by 1:00 p.m. will be ready between the 5th and 7th business day.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Please Note:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Pick-up is only available until 6:00 p.m.; orders completed after 5:00 p.m. may be picked up the next day.</li>
                    <li>Free delivery will occur on the next scheduled delivery day and does not combine with same-day production.</li>
                    <li>Same-day turnaround is only available for orders up to 500 quantity.</li>
                    <li>Same-day jobs may be printed on digital presses.</li>
                    <li>Turnaround does not begin until a job is deemed production-ready (e.g., approved proofs, no issues).</li>
                    <li>Group shipping may add at least one extra day to your turnaround time.</li>

                <p>
                    Although we endeavor to ship the exact quantity ordered, Print Phantom reserves the right to ship up to <strong>5% more or less</strong> than the requested quantity. If receiving a minimum quantity is essential, we recommend that you increase the quantity ordered to accommodate the possibility of an under run.

                <h4 class="mb-3">Order Approval / Proofing</h4>
                <p>
                    Print Phantom is not obligated to proof or review the content or layout of your order. Even if a customer service representative has previously discussed aspects of an order, this does not imply that future orders will be reviewed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    All orders are printed exactly as submitted. The customer is solely responsible for reviewing and approving the final layout, spelling, grammar, and design before submission. Print Phantom does not make any changes to customer files under any circumstances.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By submitting an order, you confirm that you are fully satisfied with the content and layout, and accept full responsibility for any errors such as:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Misspellings, grammatical mistakes</li>
                    <li>Incorrect or missing graphics</li>
                    <li>Transparency issues or overprint problems</li>
                    <li>Improper layout, bleeding, cut/fold/die lines, or crop marks</li>
                    <li>Font problems or sizing issues</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Proofs are only provided if specifically requested during the order process and if available for the selected product. If a proof is requested:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>It is your responsibility to verify all content against the original file.</li>
                    <li>The job will not be considered production-ready until written approval of the proof is received.</li>
                    <li>Turnaround time begins only after proof approval, which may affect delivery timelines.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4 class="mb-3">Promotions, Special Offers and Discount Coupons</h4>
                <p>
                    From time to time, Print Phantom may offer promotions or special offers through the use of Coupon Codes. Each code may carry unique eligibility criteria and benefits. Be sure to carefully review the terms outlined in the email or coupon you receive, as all conditions must be met to redeem the promotion.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Coupon Codes are typically one-time use and limited to active Print Phantom account holders in good standing.</li>
                    <li>Offers may be restricted by account level or status and not all products may qualify.</li>
                    <li>To apply a promotion, enter the Coupon Code in the designated field at checkout.</li>
                    <li>If a Coupon Code is invalid for a particular product, it means that product does not qualify—this decision is final.</li>
                    <li>Coupon Codes may not be combined with other offers, discounts, or rewards.</li>
                    <li>They are only valid for products purchased via the Print Phantom website, and not applicable to third-party or affiliate sales.</li>
                    <li>Custom orders are excluded unless specifically authorized by Print Phantom.</li>
                    <li>Codes cannot be applied to taxes, shipping, handling, or miscellaneous fees.</li>
                    <li>Minimum purchase amounts exclude taxes, shipping, and handling charges.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    If a discount is applied to a multi-item order, the total value of eligible items will determine the allocation of the discount. Some items may not qualify and will be excluded from the discount calculation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Promotions are time-sensitive and will expire according to the date specified, or by the end of the month in which the code was activated, if no date is mentioned.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Coupon Codes have no cash value, are non-transferable, and will not be replaced if lost or deleted.</li>
                    <li>They cannot be applied retroactively to previously placed orders.</li>
                    <li>If your full order is canceled or returned, only the amount paid (excluding the value of the promotion) will be refunded.</li>
                    <li>If part of your order is canceled or returned, the promotion will apply only to the retained items.</li>
                    <li>Promotions cannot result in a credit balance; unused promotional value is void and non-refundable.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Print Phantom reserves the right to discontinue any promotion, offer, or coupon without prior notice and with immediate effect.

                </p>
                <p>
                    Once an order has entered production or progressed beyond that stage, it cannot be canceled and no refund will be provided.
                </p>
                <p>
                    No refunds will be issued for logo or graphic design services.

                <p class="mb-4">
                    Since at least 2018, Print Phantom has absorbed increases in raw material costs, labor, and distribution expenses to shield customers from price hikes. While our production efficiencies have helped mitigate these increases, we continue to experience rising costs. Effective immediately, we will carefully review ongoing cost escalations and reserve the right to pass those costs on to our customers as needed.
